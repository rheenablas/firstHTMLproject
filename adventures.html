            <p>
                I am privileged to have lived in different countries in my lifetime. I can’t complain, 
                people would love the life I live but there are drawbacks. 
                The only thing I could do is learn and adapt along the way. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I wonder where I’ll end up next…

            <p>
                Born and raised in the Philippines,
                my family would occasionally travel to places along with other relatives and enjoy the holidays.

                    A 24-hr journey from my hometown to Bicol.
                    The traffic was absolutely mad because it was the Holy Week.
                    Lots of people were trying to go home in their provinces via public transport.
                    We were on the road from 7pm to 7pm, stopping over for food and toilet breaks.
                    Drivers changing after a while.
                    The wait was worth it, seeing <i>Mt. Mayon</i> the next day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i lang="tl">Mt. Mayon</i> is actually a volcano, popular from its perfect cone shape. The day was a
                    bit cloudy but you can see the shape nevertheless.
                    The view from above was breathtaking!

                <p>
                    <i lang="tl"> Biak na Bato</i> is a National Park located in San Miguel, Bulacan.
                    <i lang="tl"> Biak na Bato</i> translates to “broken rock”.
                    It holds a historical significance as it used to be the hideout of Philippines’
                    first president, Emilio Aguinaldo from the Spaniards.

                <p>
                    Getting in the National Park involves trekking!
                    But the rock formation, bat caves (unfortunately no Batman) and the <i lang="tl">Tilandong</i> Falls
                    was definitely worth the trip.

            <p>
                I moved to America in October, 2009.
                I lived a couple months in California with my aunt’s family,
                then moved to Texas a little while later.
                I stayed in Texas for about 4-5years until I had to move back to the Philippines.

                    Texas was significant! It was a place where I saw my potential to be excellent, 
                    not just an underdog who tried their best. I was given wonderful opportunities to 
                    meet extraordinary people, teachers and friends who pushed me towards success. 
                    Texas holds a special place in my heart.

                        organized by the church, to <i>Minute Maid Park</i>. I’m not sure who the Astros were playing against, but it was a loss. 
                        It was an experience to witness the <i>kiss cams</i> and the <i>wave</i>.

                        Schlitterbahn is one of the best waterparks I’ve been on. There are lots of slides, tubes to just float around the 
                        lazy river and tube sliding! My favorite ride is  <a href="https://www.schlitterbahn.com/galveston/rides-experiences/whitewater-river">Whitewater River</a> .
                        It takes you to rapid waters as if you were rafting without the paddles. And my favorite snack there is the funnel cake. I love me some good funnel cake!

                Even though I’ve moved numerous times, it still wasn’t easy. 
                I had to leave friends behind, repeat a school year, adjust to a new culture. 
                Little did I know, there was an adventure waiting for me.

                My first <b>impression</b> of Ireland was that it’s <b>dull</b>. The skies were always <b>cloudy</b> and it was <b>freezing</b>. 
                The city center was quite far from where I lived and the shops closes early. I do like however, the people, quite friendly.  
                I had difficulty understanding the accents but I was able to adjust fairly quickly.

                    Even if the sun was shining up high, the water was still cold. I did enjoy the view and the trekking area, so 100% would go again. 
                    And hopefully, I'll get the courage to jump off the diving spot and climb up the steep hill!

                <h4>Galway</h4>
                <p>
                    Visiting Galway was exciting. My church has organized a church day out on a bank holiday to sightsee.
                     We arrived in the <i>Cliffs of Moher</i> but unfortunately, it was too foggy at the time. 
                    We sang songs in the bus, well, I slept through it. We visited some castle and went walking.

                    The second time I visited Galway was with my cousins from America and also with the church. 
                    This time we were able to visit the cliffs even though it was drizzling a bit. 
                    My cousin was a daredevil and wanted a jump shot near the cliff. 
                    I was absolutely petrified taking the picture! But we lived, don’t worry! The picture can be viewed

            <h3>Macau</h3>
            <p>
                Our trip to Macau was during summer holidays right before the school starts definitely a memorable one.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was surprised arriving at the airport to see how smoggy the atmosphere was, nonetheless I was excited! 
                My  aunt accommodated us in Hard Rock Hotel, where we stayed for 3 days. We went sightseeing, hotel hopping, trying new foods and <i>milk tea</i>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the thing that struck me during this vacation was how the vendors interact with the tourists. 
                They spoke little of every language that I was surprised to hear my own! 
                It was memorable especially with the free taste of pork jerky!
