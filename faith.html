                In my attempt to share my testimony of finding Christ and

                fulfilment that I have experienced. Feel free to send me a message

                    <h5>Searching for answers</h5>
                    <p>
                        I was always in the <b>search</b> for <b>my purpose</b>,
                        wanting to know what I’m truly made for.
                        I found that living a <b>calculated life</b> in this unpredictable
                        world isn’t the way to go. To graduate, find a job, get married,
                        have a family, then die, is that it? In a way it feels mundane to be just
                        like one of those people. It was as if I was <b>trapped</b> with a manual labelled,
                        “average girl”. I wanted to do something more than that and I was filled with
                        ideas how but it only stayed as an idea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although I grew up in a Catholic background,
                        I <b>didn’t believe</b> in God. I knew He existed, but <b>not for me</b>.
                        I wasn’t very fond of its traditions as it seems to be monotonous.
                        I <b>didn’t</b> sing or <b>participate</b> in churches.
                        It was more of a routine than a lifestyle.
                        I fell asleep in masses, not pay attention to the preaching.
                        I wouldn’t get convicted by the message and it would seem
                        to pass my mind. I stuck with my morals and hoped for the best.
                        Same with prayer, it was a one way system for me, only reaching
                        out when I’m in deep trouble.

                    <h5>A Blessing in Disguise</h5>
                    <p>
                        My life seemed to be a series of <b>unfortunate events</b>.
                        I had to <b>move</b> countries <b>twice</b>, leave my friends behind and also
                        repeat school multiple times. It may not seem that bad but feeling
                        that the <b>universe is always against you</b> (from graduating,
                        leaving relationships behind) seems to prove me wrong.
                        Even the church that I attended here wasn’t very appealing;
                        slowly but surely it grew on me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I went to a bookshop with my family and <b>out of impulse</b> I <b>bought</b> this <b>book</b>,
                        I thought it was a novel but it turns out to be a book about this woman who <b>overcame</b> the
                        feeling of
                        <b>rejection</b> through the promises of God.
                        It struck me. I had trouble on trusting God because I don’t know His plans, I thought I was
                        <b>rejected</b>, <b>unvalued</b>, <b>unloved</b>.
                        I was such a <b>pessimist</b> that it <b>affected</b> my view of <b>life</b>, that there’s
                        nothing good in this world
                        anymore.
                        Growing up, moving to different schools, different countries, I felt like I <b>didn’t
                            belong</b>.
                        I’d see people who have friends from primary school, and I was there <b>alone</b> trying to fit
                        in with a
                        group that was already made.
                        It made me feel alone, like I had no one. I didn’t appreciate it when God moved me back to the
                        Philippines or when He moved me here in Ireland.
                        I <b>thought</b> God was <b>not for me</b> so He’s trying to complicate what I have planned in
                        my life already.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The book told me to <b>trust</b> in <b>God</b> because <b>He knows</b> what is good for you.
                        And this made it easier for me to mean the songs as I sing it. I <b>started</b> to
                        <b>believe</b> in Him.
                        I remember getting a revelation from John (my pastor). I was going through a hard time that time
                        and God
                        <b>reassured</b> me that <b>He knows</b> what I’m going through and He’s going to pull me out of
                        my problems
                        and that He will <b>be with me</b> through it all (Isaiah 43:1-3).
                        I started to surf on my problems because I know this is not my battle but God’s (2 Chronicles
                        20:15).
                        And now I know that God is the only <b>victorious</b> one here (John 16:33).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        God started to work in me, drawing me <b>closer</b> to the <b>liberating truth</b>.
                        I <b>began</b> participating in Saturday’s <b>prayer</b> and fasting, <b>joined</b> the
                        <b>worship team</b> as a backup guitarist and the youth ministry.
                        I started to <b>call</b> on <b>Jesus</b> more and understand the things that
                        was never explained or even taught of before. My <b>spirit</b> was
                        <b>convicted</b> that the <b>reason</b> I moved here is so that I could
                        <b>encounter <i>Him</i></b> and I am convinced that He prepared those events
                        in my life so I could be where I am now. I found a home in the
                        church where I was accepted and growing.

                <section>
                    <h5>It's not always rainbows and butterflies</h5>
                    <p>
                        I <b>believe</b> because He <b>intervened</b> in my life. God <b><em>used my pain</em></b> so I
                        can <b><em>dwell on Him</em></b>.
                        On the way to camping last year, my boyfriend at the time and I <b>broke up</b>. It was
                        difficult.
                        But I was sure that I wanted to give it up to God already. Before I was baptised my heart felt
                        <em>heavy</em> because of the break up.
                        But when I was <b>lifted out of the water</b>, I didn’t feel any ache, in fact I felt
                        <em>lighter</em>.
                        God <b>replaced</b> my <em>broken</em> heart to a <em>new</em> heart (Eze 36:26). God took my
                        <em>sorrows</em> and gave me <em>joy</em> (Matthew 11:28-30).
                        It was only a matter of time when I start taking in the sadness again.
                        But God <b>didn’t give up</b> on me. Every time I was on the lowest point,
                        I would <b>cry</b> out to God to take all the pain away. And He <b>listened</b>,
                        He is listening. <i>Jehovah-Rapha</i>, God my healer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Life isn’t always easy.
                        I still have it rough, <b>problems and trials are inevitable</b>.
                        But since I have a <em>faithful God</em> to come to I’m <em>secured</em> and at <em>peace</em>.
                        He’s always reminding me that there will be a rainbow after the rain,
                        that I need to just <b>fix my eyes on Him</b> (Hebrews 12:1) and worship Him in spirit and in
                        truth (John 4:24).

                    <h5>Transformation from within</h5>
                    <p>
                        He <b>knows</b> the deepest <b><em>thoughts</em></b> in our <b><em>hearts</em></b>,
                        <b><em>minds</em></b> (Psalm 44:21).
                        He is an <b>ALL-KNOWING</b> God. God has transformed me in ways that I didn’t imagine.
                        And it’s an ongoing process until Jesus comes back.
                        Trials are there so that He could reveal His mercies and unfailing love,
                        and that He is the God that can do the impossible.
                        He alone could <b>change</b> the <b>heart</b>, the <b>character</b> and all our flaws,
                        we only need to <b>yield</b> to the Spirit and let Him <b>transform</b> us (2 Corinthians 3:18).
                        Little by little, my stubbornness eased. My pessimistic mind quiet down
                        and I was <b>filled</b> with <b><em>hope</em></b> and <b><em>joy</em></b>.
                        He brings forth areas in my life that I need to improve on.

                    <h5>Encouragement</h5>
                    <p>
                        I encourage everybody to “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean
                        on your own understanding. In <b>all</b> your <b>ways</b> <b>acknowledge</b> him, and he will
                        make straight your paths.” (Proverbs 3:5-6) Things might not go according to your plan, but if
                        you have received a promise from God, He will take you there, just trust Him. It might not be
                        how you imagined it to be, but He will <b>lead</b> you (John 16:13) and He will make sure that
                        you get to your
                        destination if you let Him (Philippians 1:6).
                        Whenever it seems like there’s <b>no way</b>, <b>God</b> will <b>make a way</b> (Isaiah 43:19).
                        I was quick to analyse my reasons,
                        but I realised that God moved me to this country so I will know Him, be closer to Him. We try to
                        analyse why things happen in our lives, but when you trust God, it shouldn’t matter why. In
                        Jeremiah 29:11 says, “For I know the plans I have for you” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper
                        you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”

            <h3>Worship Music</h3>
            <p>
                Songs have an appeal to our soul. The good kind can make you feel upbeat,
                the wrong ones can lead you to depression. In a way, we are in control
                what we allow into our spirit. <em><b>Listening</b></em> to worship music <b>allows</b> me to be
                at <em><b>peace</b></em> and also be <b>reminded</b> of the <em><b>goodness</b></em> and the
                <em><b>miraculous wonders</b></em> of <b>God</b>.
